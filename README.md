# Bears-Team-17

## Chingu-Voyage Cohort 4

## Introduction
Hi, Welcome to Bear-Team 17, the team takes four members,(see members below). The team together accepted to create an application from the new Idea, we still believe the learning experience as a team by cloning an existing application may take the same effort or a little more if we implement a new project idea. But the effort will be of great value if we add to the world a new realistic simple application that may help our life.
